# Cinemaple Movie Night Management Web Application


## **Introduction**:

Movie Nights are recurring events that need some organizational overhead, such as inviting people, selecting movies, and performing a movie survey. In a quest for a standalone solution not involving Facebook and Co., the goal is to develop a Web Application able to carry out this overhead. This project is deployed at [Cinemaple](https://www.cinemaple.com/)


## **Contribute**:

Cinemaple is built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) and is open source: We look forward to your contributions. Check back later to find a more detailed guide on how to set up the Cinemaple environement and on how to contribute.
